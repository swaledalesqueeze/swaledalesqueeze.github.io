## 16-18 May 2025

[Booking through EventBee (opens 1st Dec 2024)](https://swaledale-squeeze-2025.eventbee.com)

The Swaledale Squeeze is a convivial weekend of concertina playing, meeting friends, a concert, a ceilidh, sessions, the comfort of Grinton Lodge and fantastic scenery â€“ what more could a concertina player ask for? Everything is centred on Grinton Lodge (a former shooting lodge), now a Youth Hostel, based just outside Reeth in the Yorkshire Dales.

The guest tutors for the 2025 squeeze are

- Andy Turner on Anglo
- Sam Partridge on English
- Pam Bishop on Duet

Our regular tutors are Alex Wade (English), Harry Scurfield (Anglo), Paul Walker (English/Anglo), Carolyn Wade (Band) and Dave Ball (English). Together they provide workshops covering a whole range of concertina playing for different abilities, systems and styles. Theo Gibb is joining on Saturday for any instrument repairs.

The weekend starts on Friday evening with informal sessions including the Dotty session, with written music provided for the tunes. Saturday includes teaching workshops in the morning and afternoon, an informal tea-time concert and a ceilidh in the evening in Reeth, with the band for the ceilidh and the 'spots' provided by participants. There are more workshops on Sunday morning before the farewell concert on Sunday afternoon, again in Reeth, featuring spots from the tutors and their workshop groups.
